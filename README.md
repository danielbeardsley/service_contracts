# Service Contracts
This is a collection of simple and relatively generic service contracts
for the Design / Development crowd.

## How To Use
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Create a non-public branch for each client and fill in the details: names,
rates, specific terms, ...
	* Send the contract back and forth in plain text or use Google Documents
	  until the terms have been finalized.
3. Convert the Markdown to HTML with something like [Formattr](http://formattr.heroku.com)
4. Then add something like: "contract id: 87ffdsf4" to the footer with the
	 first 8 characters of the commit id that represents the final contract.
5. Create a PDF of the document with your signature and send it to the client.
